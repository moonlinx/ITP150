Here's an explanation of why this code works and what it does:

1. The code simulates a random selection process, similar to rolling a 10-sided die many times.

2. We use a large number of iterations (1,000,000) to get a good statistical sample.

3. The `numList` keeps track of how many times each index (0 to 9) is randomly selected.

4. In the main loop, we use `random.random()` to generate a float between 0 and 1, then multiply it by the length of the list (10) and convert to an integer. This gives us a random index between 0 and 9.

5. We increment the count for the randomly selected index in `numList`.

6. After all iterations, we print the final counts for each index.

7. We calculate the expected value, which is the total number of iterations divided by the number of possible outcomes (10 in this case). In a perfectly random distribution, we'd expect each index to be selected this many times.

8. Finally, we compare the actual results with the expected value, printing out the difference for each index.

This code demonstrates the law of large numbers and how random selections tend to approach an even distribution over a large number of trials. The differences from the expected value show how much variation there is in the randomness.
