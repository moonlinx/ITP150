## Warmup

Given a list of numbers, compute the standard deviation of the numbers.

- You can always google `standard deviation` if you don't know what it is.
- _OR_ you can use the [standard deviation formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Calculating_the_standard_deviation)

```python
def standard_deviation(numbers):
  numList = [6,2,3,1]

  # Calculate the mean
  Loop:

  # Calculate the sum of each item - mean (x,-mean)^2
  Loop:
    sum t =

# Divide by length of the list

# take square root of the result num**.5
```

## Sets

- sets are lists with no duplicates
- sets are unordered
- sets are mutable (they can be changed)
- sets are iterable

```python
names = {"John", "Olin", "Apple"}
# You can add to sets
names.add("Greg")
```

- You can add a tuple or a list to a set
- Once that is done then all duplicates will be removed

## Dictionaries

- Dictionaries are unordered
- Dictionaries use {} brackets
- Dictionaries are mutable (they can be changed)
- Dictionaries are iterable
- Dictionaries have key:value pairs:
  - `key` = `value`
- You can have anything as a value within a dictionary

```python
thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
"year": 2020 # duplicates are overwritten
}

```
